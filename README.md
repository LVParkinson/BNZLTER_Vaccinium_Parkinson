Honestly, the code is a mess. Sorry.  

**PCA.R** calcualtions of the site level variables (e.g. soil moisture, canopy cover) along with the PCA and the cronbach's alpha from the PLOS publication  
**Chapter2.R** calculations used or related to research in the second chapter of the thesis  
**Morphology.R** has many similar caluculations to "Chapter2.R" but also the figures used in the thesis and PLOS publication
